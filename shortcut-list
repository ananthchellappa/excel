CTRL ALT N : Open a *copy* of the active sheet as a new Book - so you can hack at will
CTRL SHIFT C : Create a copy of the active sheet in the same workbook
CTRL SHIFT ] : Enter "Highlight row and column of active cell" mode (with a confirm dialog when custom highlighting detected on the sheet) (aka CrossHair)
CTRL SHIFT [ : Exit "Highlight row and column of active cell" mode
CTRL SHIFT F : Filter table (if already filtered using another column, then add to the filtering) by only showing (of the currently visible rows) 
               only those for which this column's entry matches the active cell's value
CTRL SHIFT N : Set filter to the next value in this column's element list
CTRL SHIFT B : Set filter to previous value in this column's element list
CTRL SHIFT E : Exclude filter (add to) - of the visible rows, filter out (don't show) rows for which this column's entry matches active cell's value
CTRL SHIFT X : If active cell is in a table, then create a new sheet with that cell's entire row data displayed in an easy to read format, with a CLOSE button.
               Try it out! (Thanks Shubh and Kopal Kaushik) (New sheet is called Legend)
CTRL ALT SHIFT DEL : Delete active sheet without confirmation!
