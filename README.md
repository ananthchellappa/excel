Personal macro workbook and other helpful stuff

Please check out the YouTube video on how to use this (coming soon)

What is the personal macro workbook and why should you care :

It is a collection of routines that are available to use in ANY other workbook.
If there are certain routines you love, such as for filtering tables, then, if you use
the personal macro workbook, you have those available to you - whereas, if you didn't use
the personal macro workbook approach, you'd have to include these macros in that other
workbook and save it as a macro enabled workbook.

What if someone sent you a plan xlsx with tables that you now want to manipulate (just for
analysis). If you didn't have the personal macro workbook, you'd have to first insert your
favourite routines into that workbook to be able to use them.

Where is it stored?

This can vary. The easiest way to find this out, something you have to know if you wan to use
someone eise's PMWB, is to create a dummy PMWB and then view it and see what the location is :

In the Developer (how do you get this on your Ribbon? Google it!) tab, go to Record Macro and
then, filling out the form, choose Personal Macro Workbook. Save a dummy macro - that is, start,
click on a cell and then stop and then. Go to the View Tab and click on Unhide and choose
PERSONAL. Then, with the PERSONAL macro workbook open, you can just do File Save as to see where
it is currently saved.

How do I use someone elses Personal Macro Workbook (PMWB)?

Having found out where Excel stores your PMWB, exit Excel and then, go to that location and delete
the dummy PWMB and now move the one you want to use to that location. Make sure the PMWB is
from someone you trust. The source code should be available.

Having said that, how should you use the PMWB featured here if you don't trust it?

Ans : Use the attached source code - you can put it all into a single module within your dummy PMWB
if you wish.
